<strong>Background about myself</strong>
<p>I was born June 21st of 2002 in Kettering city hospital. I am 19 years old and I have lived in Ohio all of my life. I have latino decent because my mother was born in Bogota, Colombia. My father on the other hand was born in York, Pennsylvania but has german decent. But compared to my sister I got more of the Latino gene.  </p>

<p>I went to school for the first 10 grades at Springboro but junior year my family and I moved to lebanon and I had a choice to either go to the highschool or spend my last two years at Warren County Career Center. I choose the career center and the career path I choose was Digital design, a hobby in which I still use to this day and I'm still learning from UC Blue Ash </p>

<p>Freshman year of highschool was pretty scary for many reasons. It was the beginning of my last four years and the fact that I was the smallest and chubbiest in most of my classes. Only being at the height of 5'3" and not looking very threatning you can guessed I was bullied pretty much everyday. So I decided that I wanted to do a sport and I choose swim because I thought to myself "Hey, I don't drown when I go swimming.....I should be fine". First day of practice I wanted to quit immediatly but my mom said I had to stick with it. Then throughout that year I hit my growth spurt and hit a nice 5'9" and bulked up and nobody bullied me again.</p>

<p>I have always found my self to me a creative person but I could never show it to people physically. I was never good at writting because I have ADHD and I never had an artists hand, I was barely good at drawing stickmen from scratch. But in sophmore year where a class called digital design was being introduced I took that class and to this day still love learning everything about Adobe and coding and it is a real thing that I can show people and to explain art to people and have an interest in a hobby that will be futuristic.</p>
